## Build a Pokémon Search App

In this project, you'll build an app that will search for Pokémon by name or ID and display the results to the user. To retrieve the Pokémon data and images, you'll use freeCodeCamp's PokéAPI Proxy.

### Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://pokemon-search-app.freecodecamp.rocks

### User Stories:

1. You should have an input element with an id of "search-input"
2. You should have a button element with an id of "search-button"
3. You should have an element with an id of "pokemon-name"
4. You should have an element with an id of "pokemon-id"
5. You should have an element with an id of "weight"
6. You should have an element with an id of "height"
7. You should have an element with an id of "types"
8. You should have an element with an id of "hp"
9. You should have an element with an id of "attack"
10. You should have an element with an id of "defense"
11. You should have an element with an id of "special-attack"
12. You should have an element with an id of "special-defense"
13. You should have an element with an id of "speed"
14. When the #search-input element contains the value Red and the #search-button element is clicked, an alert should appear with the text "Pokémon not found"
15. When the #search-input element contains the value Pikachu and the #search-button element is clicked, the values in the #pokemon-name, #pokemon-id, #weight, #height, #hp, #attack, #defense, #special-attack, #special-defense, and #speed elements should be PIKACHU, #25 or 25, Weight: 60 or 60, Height: 4 or 4, 35, 55, 40, 50, 50, and 90, respectively
16. When the #search-input element contains the value Pikachu and the #search-button element is clicked, you should add an img element with the id of "sprite" and the src set to the Pokémon's front_default sprite to the page
17. When the #search-input element contains the value Pikachu and the #search-button element is clicked, the #types element should contain a single inner element with the value ELECTRIC. The #types element content should be cleared between searches
18. When the #search-input element contains the value 94 and the #search-button element is clicked, the values in the #pokemon-name, #pokemon-id, #weight, #height, #hp, #attack, #defense, #special-attack, #special-defense, and #speedelements should be GENGAR, #94 or 94, Weight: 405 or 405, Height: 15 or 15, 60, 65, 60, 130, 75, and 110, respectively
19. When the #search-input element contains the value 94 and the #search-button element is clicked, you should add an img element with the id of sprite and the src set to the Pokémon's front_default sprite to the page
20. When the #search-input element contains the value 94 and the #search-button element is clicked, the #types element should contain two inner elements with the text values GHOST and POISON, respectively. The #types element content should be cleared between searches
